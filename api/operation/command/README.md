COMMAND
=======

Commands are exclusively defined as "Containerized runs" that are
allowed to connect to service/storage containers in an application.

It is hoped that this definition will be able to meet all operational
needs for an application, from preparation steps like building, to
execution steps like flushing a cache, or populating a database.
