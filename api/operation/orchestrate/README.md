ORCHESTRATE 
===========

Orchestration operations are meant to control the state
of the app.

Orchestration is analogous to either swarm, compose or
direct Docker control operations, and typically centers
around Up, Down, Start, Stop etc.
Additional orchestration Operations should be used for
release, branching and forking concepts.

## QUESTION should branching/releasing be it's own concept?
