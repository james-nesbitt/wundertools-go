/**
 * Properties are abstract Operations values which
 * are meant to be accessed from outside of an operation
 * to either retrieve or assign.
 * This file provides a property collection struct,
 * and the interface for a single Property
 *
 * A Peroperty consumer should either recognize the
 * Operation by it's keys, and then handle it's Properties
 * as "knowns", or it should iterate through the Properties
 * and use some user-interface to allow interaction.
 *
 * A Property is typically used, by overwriting it's
 * value before running the operation, or by retreiving it's
 * value after the operation has executed.
